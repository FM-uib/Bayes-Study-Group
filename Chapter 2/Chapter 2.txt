Exercise

Compute the probability of having the disease

First probability of positive test result
two option having the disease and getting positive result
not havin the disease and getting positive result

p(+) = p(+|D) * p(D) + p(+|not D) * p(not D)

p(+) = .99 * .05 + (1-.95) * .95 = 0.097

p(D|+) = p(+|D) * p(D) / p(+)

p(D|+) = .99 * .05 / .097 = .5103

The chance of having the disease is 51% given a positive test result
